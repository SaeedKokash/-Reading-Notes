# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming #

## What are the 6 reasons for pair programming? ##
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? ##
Learning from fellow students could be very beneficial for me because we can teach each other in different ways and gain more experience together.

## How does pair programming work? ##
Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
