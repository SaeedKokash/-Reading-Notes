# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry #


## What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science? ##
The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up? ##
As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

## When are diversity efforts most successful? ##
when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters

## Why do diverse companies perform better? ##
diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones

## Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa. ##
When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies
