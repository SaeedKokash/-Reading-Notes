## Who is Roy Fielding? ##
he is a smart guy who helped writing the first web servers, he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

## Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? ##
Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? ##
HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

## What does a GET do? ##
GET is used when a systems would retrieve information from each other

## What does a POST do? ##
POST is used when a system needs to add something to another system

## What does PUT do? ##
PUT is used when a system wants to replace something in another system

## What does PATCH do? ##
Patch is used to do a partial update
