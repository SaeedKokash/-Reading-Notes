**PATCH** is a method of modifying resources where the client sends partial data that is to be updated without modifying the entire data. 

## Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to "mock" an API for development like json-server ##
1. Nock
2. MockServer
3. Beeceptor

## Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call? ##
- 400 Bad Request – client sent an invalid request, such as lacking required request body or parameter
- 401 Unauthorized – client failed to authenticate with the server
- 403 Forbidden – client authenticated but does not have permission to access the requested resource
- 404 Not Found – the requested resource does not exist
- 412 Precondition Failed – one or more conditions in the request header fields evaluated to false
- 500 Internal Server Error – a generic error occurred on the server
- 503 Service Unavailable – the requested service is not available

## Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST ##
| SOAP | ReST |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Relies on SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) | Relies on REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture using HTTP. |
| Transports data in standard XML format. | Generally transports data in JSON. It is based on URI. Because REST follows stateless model, REST does not enforces message format as XML or JSON etc. |
| Because it is XML based and relies on SOAP, it works with WSDL | It works with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE |
| Works over HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, XMPP | Works over HTTP and HTTPS |
| Highly structured/typed | Less structured -> less bulky data |
| Designed with large enterprise applications in mind | Designed with mobile devices in mind |
