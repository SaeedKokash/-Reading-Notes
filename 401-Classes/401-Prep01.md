# SQL #

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and simply put, it’s a search language for you to instruct a
database about what information you’d like retrieved from it.

## SELECT ##

Note that each query needs to end in a semi-colon. for example: 
- SELECT 'We are just getting started.';
- SELECT 2 + 3;

## FROM ##

SELECT [stuff you want to select] FROM [the table that it is in];

## * Splat ##

Sometimes it’s annoying to have to list out all the columns that you want to fetch. If yousimply want all the columns available SQL has the * shortcut. The * is called a “splat” and is a handy, frequently used shortcut to get all columns.

SELECT * FROM [tablename]

## ORDER BY ##

By default results are returned in the order that they’re stored in the database. But sometimes you’ll want to sort them differently. You can do that with the “ORDER BY” command at the end of your queries as shown in the expanded version of our SQL template here

SELECT [stuff you want to select] FROM [the table that it is in] ORDER BY [column you want to order by]

## LIMIT ##

If want to LIMIT the number of results that are returned you can simply use the LIMIT command with a number of rows to LIMIT by.

SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT [Number to Limit By]; For example: SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT 3;

## OFFSET ##

SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT 5 OFFSET [Number of rows to skip]; For example: SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT 5 OFFSET 2;

## 1. SQL Lesson 1: SELECT queries 101
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable;
```

## 2. SQL Lesson 2: Queries with constraints (Pt. 1)
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;
 ```
    
| Operator | Condition | SQL Example |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| =, !=, < <=, >, >= | Standard numerical operators | col_name != 4 |
| BETWEEN … AND … | Number is within range of two values (inclusive) | col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5 |
| NOT BETWEEN … AND … | Number is not within range of two values (inclusive) | col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10 |
| IN (…) | Number exists in a list | col_name IN (2, 4, 6) |
| NOT IN (…) | Number does not exist in a list | col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5) |

## 3. SQL Lesson 3: Queries with constraints (Pt. 2)

| Operator | Condition | SQL Example |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| = | Case sensitive exact string comparison (notice the single equals)	| col_name = "abc" | 
| != or <>	| Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison	| col_name != "abcd" | 
| LIKE	| Case insensitive exact string comparison	| col_name LIKE "ABC" | 
| NOT LIKE	| Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison	| col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD" | 
| %	| Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	| col_name LIKE "%AT%" (matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even "BATS") | 
| _	| Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE) | col_name LIKE "AN_" (matches "AND", but not "AN") | 
| IN (…) | String exists in a list	| col_name IN ("A", "B", "C") | 
| NOT IN (…) | String does not exist in a list	| col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F") |

## 13. SQL Lesson 13: Inserting rows

INSERT
```
Insert statement with values for all columns
INSERT INTO mytable
VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
       (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …),
       …;
       
       
Insert statement with specific columns
INSERT INTO mytable
(column, another_column, …)
VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
      (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …),

### Table data types

| Data type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| INTEGER, BOOLEAN | The integer datatypes can store whole integer values like the count of a number or an age. In some implementations, the boolean value is just represented as an integer value of just 0 or 1. |
| FLOAT, DOUBLE, REAL | The floating point datatypes can store more precise numerical data like measurements or fractional values. Different types can be used depending on the floating point precision required for that value. |
| CHARACTER(num_chars), VARCHAR(num_chars), TEXT | The text based datatypes can store strings and text in all sorts of locales. The distinction between the various types generally amount to underlaying efficiency of the database when working with these columns. Both the CHARACTER and VARCHAR (variable character) types are specified with the max number of characters that they can store (longer values may be truncated), so can be more efficient to store and query with big tables. |
| DATE, DATETIME | SQL can also store date and time stamps to keep track of time series and event data. They can be tricky to work with especially when manipulating data across timezones. |
| BLOB | Finally, SQL can store binary data in blobs right in the database. These values are often opaque to the database, so you usually have to store them with the right metadata to requery them. |

### Table constraints

| Constraint | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| PRIMARY KEY | This means that the values in this column are unique, and each value can be used to identify a single row in this table. |
| AUTOINCREMENT | 	For integer values, this means that the value is automatically filled in and incremented with each row insertion. Not supported in all databases. |
| UNIQUE | This means that the values in this column have to be unique, so you can't insert another row with the same value in this column as another row in the table. Differs from the `PRIMARY KEY` in that it doesn't have to be a key for a row in the table. |
| NOT NULL | This means that the inserted value can not be `NULL`. |
| CHECK (expression) | 	This allows you to run a more complex expression to test whether the values inserted are valid. For example, you can check that values are positive, or greater than a specific size, or start with a certain prefix, etc. |
| FOREIGN KEY | 	This is a consistency check which ensures that each value in this column corresponds to another value in a column in another table. For example, if there are two tables, one listing all Employees by ID, and another listing their payroll information, the `FOREIGN KEY` can ensure that every row in the payroll table corresponds to a valid employee in the master Employee list. |

### EXAMPLE SCHEMA

```
Movies table schema
CREATE TABLE movies (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    director TEXT,
    year INTEGER, 
    length_minutes INTEGER
);
```
