# SQL #

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and simply put, it’s a search language for you to instruct a
database about what information you’d like retrieved from it.

## SELECT ##

Note that each query needs to end in a semi-colon. for example: 
- SELECT 'We are just getting started.';
- SELECT 2 + 3;

## FROM ##

SELECT [stuff you want to select] FROM [the table that it is in];

## * Splat ##

Sometimes it’s annoying to have to list out all the columns that you want to fetch. If yousimply want all the columns available SQL has the * shortcut. The * is called a “splat” and is a handy, frequently used shortcut to get all columns.

SELECT * FROM [tablename]

## ORDER BY ##

By default results are returned in the order that they’re stored in the database. But sometimes you’ll want to sort them differently. You can do that with the “ORDER BY” command at the end of your queries as shown in the expanded version of our SQL template here

SELECT [stuff you want to select] FROM [the table that it is in] ORDER BY [column you want to order by]

## LIMIT ##

If want to LIMIT the number of results that are returned you can simply use the LIMIT command with a number of rows to LIMIT by.

SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT [Number to Limit By]; For example: SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT 3;

## OFFSET ##

SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT 5 OFFSET [Number of rows to skip]; For example: SELECT * FROM artists LIMIT 5 OFFSET 2;

1. SQL Lesson 1: SELECT queries 101
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable;
```
!()[]

2. SQL Lesson 2: Queries with constraints (Pt. 1)
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;
 ```
    
| Operator | Condition | SQL Example |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| =, !=, < <=, >, >= | Standard numerical operators | col_name != 4 |
| BETWEEN … AND … | Number is within range of two values (inclusive) | col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5 |
| NOT BETWEEN … AND … | Number is not within range of two values (inclusive) | col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10 |
| IN (…) | Number exists in a list | col_name IN (2, 4, 6) |
| NOT IN (…) | Number does not exist in a list | col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5) |

3. SQL Lesson 3: Queries with constraints (Pt. 2)

| Operator | Condition | SQL Example |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| = | Case sensitive exact string comparison (notice the single equals)	| col_name = "abc" | 
| != or <>	| Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison	| col_name != "abcd" | 
| LIKE	| Case insensitive exact string comparison	| col_name LIKE "ABC" | 
| NOT LIKE	| Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison	| col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD" | 
| %	| Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)	| col_name LIKE "%AT%" (matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even "BATS") | 
| _	| Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE) | col_name LIKE "AN_" (matches "AND", but not "AN") | 
| IN (…) | String exists in a list	| col_name IN ("A", "B", "C") | 
| NOT IN (…) | String does not exist in a list	| col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F") |

4. SQL Lesson 4: Filtering and sorting Query results

DISTINCT
```
SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s);
```

ORDER BY
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;
```

LIMIT
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

!()[]

6. SQL Lesson 6: Multi-table queries with JOINs

Multi-table queries with JOINs
```
Select query with INNER JOIN on multiple tables
SELECT column, another_table_column, …
FROM mytable
INNER JOIN another_table 
    ON mytable.id = another_table.id
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```
